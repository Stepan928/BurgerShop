## ü§ñ Introduction
This project is a recreation of the Jevelin Burger Shop website, aimed at providing an improved user experience. I rebuilt it from scratch, resolving issues and adding new features to enhance its functionality. It serves as a comprehensive landing page, offering an engaging information hub with a seamless user interface and captivating visuals. It's important to note that this platform beautifully showcases the essence of the website's content but does not process real orders.
